    <p>I am from Eastern Washington and grew in an area rich in places to go recreate in the outdoors.
        Some of my favorite things to door are go hiking and camping, sports of every kind and playing on the water. Currently I am pursuing a degree in software engineering. I am in my 6th semester here at BYU-Idaho and have loved it so far!</p>
    <p>I have 17 people in my family, 15 kids and my parents and I love spending time with them. Fortunately most of us live really close to eachother and get the opportunity to get together often which is an absolute blast!
        I also am currently preparing to get married in the end of December and suoer excited for that but am slightly nervous too, but it's a good nervous haha. Any advice i much appreciated lol!

    <p>I have been a member of the church my whole life and so maybe am a little biased when I say this, but going to a church school is the best experience ever and I am grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this community. I am especially grateful
        that I can come get an education that is focused on God and doing good unto others and being an active and good contributing citizen to society. I think a career in tech is super benefial not only because of the perks that can come with it such as pay
        and being able to work remotely if you want to, but also just having a job in an industry that is growing more and more every single day.
